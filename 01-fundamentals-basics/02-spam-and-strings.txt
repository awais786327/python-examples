===============
2.1 strings

first_name = 'John'
last_name = 'Doe'
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
print(full_name)

---
external files 
script.py
>>> python script.py
John Doe

---
comments
# this is a comment
# here hash to be called as "pound"

---
//typecasting
convert the "int" to string before concatenating with string values

age = 25
phrase = 'i am ' + str(age) + ' years old.'

---
special characters in strings
\t for tabs
\n for new lines

x = '\n\tHellen Goose'
y = 'daddy\'s girl'

print('my prints: ', x, y) // will print indented

===============
2.2 string behind the scenes

x = 'hello'
>>> x[0] // 'h'

# what about incorrect index ? try this
>>> x[10]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: string index out of range

---
len - tells the length of the string

x = len('hello')
>>> x  # 5

---
slicing strings (boundary)

word = 'python'
>>>word[2:5] # 'tho' - word[ startIndex : beforeEndIndex]

# also
>>> word[2:] # 'thon' - from 2 to till the end 
>>> word[:3] # 'pyt' - from start till index 3

# no error with incorrect index portion when ":" slicing is used
>>>> word[100:]

--- 
integer division

x = 'evening' # length is 7
>>> x[ len(x) / 2 ] # error because 3.5 is not an index
>>> x[ len(x) // 2 ] # index will be 3. because (7 // 2) gives 3. (must for py3)
