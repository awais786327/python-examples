===============
3.1 conditionals

---
comparators (comparison operators)
there are 6 of them
<, <=, ==, >=, >, and !=

>>> 5 == 5 # True - notice the capital "T" unlike JS 
>>> 5 != 5 # False

---
- booleans.. True or False
is_raining = True

---
- if else

num_knights = 2

if num_knights < 3:
  print('Retreat !') # this is called code block - indented with 4 spaces
  print('Another nested statement')
else:
  print('March on yayy !')
print('this always runs as norm, not an else block') 

---
# another example with if, else if, and else
rain_speed = 6

if rain_speed < 5:
    print('Just a Scotch mist')
elif rain_speed < 7:
    print('achi barish hy')
elif rain_speed <= 10:
    print('solid barish hy')
else:
    print('It\'s a real Cow-quaker out there')

---
combining conditionals (and, or)

if rain_speed < 5 or day === "Monday":
  print('do something')

elif rains_speed and day === "We dnesday":
  print('do something else')

-----
taking input from the user
x = input('please enter the age')
>>>print(x) # '25' - we have to typecast it as int(x) to a number.
